      <h2>How a Criminal Became the Drift King</h2>
      <p>
        Keiichi Tsuchiya, born on January 30, 1956, is a legendary Japanese
        professional race car driver renowned as the Drift King (ドリキン,
        Dorikin) for his groundbreaking use of drifting in non-drifting racing
        events and his pivotal role in popularizing drifting as a motorsport.
        Beyond his drifting prowess, Tsuchiya is a two-time 24 Hours of Le Mans
        class winner and the 2001 All Japan GT Championship runner-up in the
        realm of professional racing. Driving his iconic Toyota AE86 Sprinter
        Trueno, affectionately known as "Hachi-Roku" (hachi-roku meaning "eight
        six") in Japan, Tsuchiya has transformed this car into a symbol of
        automotive excellence. Often referred to as "The Little Hachi that
        could," his skillful touge driving is captured in the 2-part video 'The
        Touge,' produced by Pluspy (+P). Tsuchiya's influence extends beyond the
        racetrack, as he served as a consultant for the popular manga and anime
        series, Initial D, where the character Takumi Fujiwara is inspired by
        him. Additionally, he contributed to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo
        Drift as a stunt coordinator and stuntman, making a memorable cameo
        appearance in the film.

        Keiichi Tsuchiya embarked on his racing journey in 1977, starting with
        the Fuji Freshman series. In a departure from the conventional path of
        drivers hailing from affluent backgrounds or established motorsport
        pedigrees, Tsuchiya honed his skills through street racing, earning
        recognition in the underground racing scene. His racing career unfolded
        across diverse championships, including the Japanese Formula Three
        Championship and Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), where he
        piloted vehicles like the Cosmo Oil Sierra Cosworth, Nissan Skyline GT-R
        with Team Taisan, and a Honda Civic in Supertouring car championships.
        Tsuchiya's versatility extended to Le Mans, where he achieved a class
        win and 8th place overall in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans driving a
        Honda NSX. Notably, his endurance racing exploits continued in 1999 with
        a Toyota GT-One, showcasing resilience in the face of adversity. Beyond
        conventional racing circuits, Tsuchiya delved into NASCAR-sanctioned
        exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi Superspeedway,
        adding an international flavor to his racing portfolio. Intriguingly,
        his drifting career intersected with moments of turbulence during his
        early circuit racing days, as documented in Pluspy's recordings of
        illegal racing. Despite the challenges, Tsuchiya emerged as a mentor,
        advising aspiring racers in the movie series Shuto Kousoku Trial to
        abandon the illegal racing scene if they aspired to pursue a
        professional racing career.

        Post-retirement, Keiichi Tsuchiya took on various roles that showcased
        his multi-faceted expertise in the realm of motorsports. Serving as Team
        Director for both GT500 and GT300 Class of ARTA JGTC Team, he navigated
        the team through the intricacies of professional racing until the GT300
        operation disbanded in 2005. Tsuchiya's entrepreneurial spirit was
        evident as he owned the aftermarket company Kei Office, later selling it
        in 2005 to establish DG-5. Departing from the D1 scene in January 2011,
        he co-founded the amateur drifting series Drift Muscle, assuming the
        additional role of a judge. His distinctive jade green trademark color
        adorned his overalls, helmet, and the vehicles associated with his
        former company. Tsuchiya's influence extended to hosting the video
        magazine "Best Motoring," featuring road tests of new Japanese cars and
        the "Hot Version" section focusing on performance-modified cars. As a
        guest presenter in Video Option and Drift Tengoku, he shared insights
        with fellow racing drivers. Beyond the racing circuits, Tsuchiya
        contributed to televised anime such as Initial D and Wangan Midnight,
        also making cameo appearances in films like The Fast and the Furious:
        Tokyo Drift, where he served as a stunt coordinator and stuntman. In
        2014, he ventured into a joint venture with King of Europe ProSeries,
        establishing the King of Asia ProSeries, and assumed a key role as a
        judge in significant races for the King of Europe Drift ProSeries.
        Tsuchiya's enduring presence in the motorsports world, coupled with his
        cameo roles and joint ventures, solidifies his legacy as a driving force
        in the global automotive community.
