      <h2>How Mercedes Lost Their Minds, and Won</h2>
      <p>
        After withdrawing from the upper echelons of sportscar racing following
        the 1955 Le Mans disaster, Mercedes-Benz rekindled its presence in
        motorsport in 1985. Initially serving as an engine supplier to Sauber,
        Mercedes later became a full-time works partner, clinching the World
        Sportscar Championship in 1989 and 1990. However, disappointment led to
        their withdrawal at the end of 1991. Finding success in the Deutsche
        Tourenwagen Meisterschaft with the 190 E Evo II, Mercedes dominated the
        series with the W202 C-Class from 1994 to 1996, causing the
        championship's closure in 1996. Seeking new challenges, Mercedes turned
        to the FIA GT Championship, where the dominant McLaren F1 GTR inspired
        the creation of the CLK GTR. Developed in just 128 days, it shared
        minimal components with its road counterpart, the Mercedes-Benz CLK.
        Utilizing McLaren F1 GTR chassis #11R as a mule, the CLK GTR featured
        AMG's bodywork and a Mercedes M120 V12 engine. This swift development
        resulted in a formidable racing machine, marking a remarkable chapter in
        Mercedes' motorsport legacy.

        Constructed by Lola Composites, a division of Lola Cars, the chassis of
        the CLK GTR featured a carbon-fibre monocoque paired with an aluminium
        honeycomb frame. Powering this formidable racing machine was a modified
        version of the M120 engine from the R129 SL-Class and W140 S-Class,
        known as the LS600 or GT 112. While maintaining a bore and stroke of 89
        mm and 80.2 mm, respectively, the engine underwent significant
        enhancements, including titanium connecting rods and a heightened
        compression ratio from 10.0:1 to 12.0:1. These modifications propelled
        the engine's output to an impressive 600 PS (592 hp; 441 kW) at 7,000
        rpm, with torque reaching 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) at 3,900 rpm, enabling the
        CLK GTR to achieve a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph). Positioned
        amidships behind the driver, the engine, also serving as a stressed
        member, transmitted power to the rear wheels through a 6-speed
        sequential manual transmission, resulting in a rapid 0–100 km/h (0–62
        mph) acceleration time of 3.8 seconds. Notably, various driving aids
        such as traction control, ABS, active suspension, and drive-by-wire
        throttle control were prohibited, with only fore-aft brake bias
        permitted. The front and rear suspension, featuring double wishbones
        with pull-rod actuated coil springs and adjustable shocks, remained
        identical, contributing to the CLK GTR's remarkable racing performance.

        The CLK GTR made its debut at Mercedes' home track, the Hockenheimring,
        during the 1997 FIA GT Hockenheim 4 Hours. Despite Bernd Schneider
        securing pole position and the fastest lap, braking problems forced an
        early retirement. The sister No. 10 CLK GTR faced its own mechanical
        challenges, finishing in 27th place. Undeterred, Mercedes invested in
        intensive development during the summer break, leading to a remarkable
        turnaround. Schneider and Klaus Ludwig clinched a triumphant 1-2 finish
        at the 1997 FIA GT Nürburgring 4 Hours. The remainder of the season
        witnessed the CLK GTR achieving three more 1-2 finishes, with notable
        victories at the 1997 FIA GT Sebring 3 Hours and 1997 FIA GT Laguna Seca
        3 Hours. This success culminated in Mercedes securing both the
        constructors' and drivers' championships in their inaugural season, with
        Schneider at the helm. Opting out of the 24 Hours of Le Mans that year,
        Mercedes and AMG recognized that the V12 in the CLK GTR was better
        suited to the shorter sprints of the FIA GT Championship. Instead, they
        decided to develop a dedicated car for the following year's Le Mans,
        resulting in the evolution of the CLK GTR known as the CLK LM. Alongside
        its GT1 counterparts, the Porsche 911 GT1 and McLaren F1 GTR, the trio
        formed the celebrated "holy trinity" of Group GT1, marking a golden era
        or pinnacle of 90s sportscar racing according to various publications.
