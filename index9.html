      <h2>The Billion Dollar Gamble... Was it Worth it?</h2>
      <p>
        The Series 1 Mazda RX-7, produced from 1978 to 1980 and commonly known
        as the "SA22C," marked a significant chapter in Mazda's automotive
        history. Matasaburo Maeda, the lead designer at Mazda, crafted a
        masterpiece that not only replaced the Savanna RX-3 in Japan but also
        showcased the brand's commitment to rotary engine-powered excellence.
        The RX-7, designated as X605 during its internal development, stood out
        with its minimal size, lightweight design, and a compact rotary engine
        strategically positioned behind the front axle for optimal weight
        distribution. This configuration granted the RX-7 a low center of
        gravity, a key factor in its sports car prowess. Beyond its engineering
        marvel, the RX-7 gained favor in the Japanese market by complying with
        government dimension regulations, sparing buyers from yearly taxes for
        driving a larger car. The rotary engine's displacement below 1,500 cc
        further appealed to Japanese consumers due to its cost-effective road
        tax implications. In May 1980, Mazda introduced the Leathersport Models
        in North America, a limited edition with distinctive features like LS
        badges, gold anodized wheels, and full brown leather upholstery. This
        special edition, available in Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar
        Gold, added a touch of luxury to the RX-7's performance-oriented
        lineage. The Series 1 RX-7, with its exposed steel bumpers and unique
        rear license plate indentation, left an indelible mark on automotive
        enthusiasts, capturing the essence of design excellence and engineering
        innovation.

        The second-generation RX-7, often referred to as "FC," exhibited a
        comprehensive redesign, embracing the softer sport-tourer trends of its
        time while enhancing handling and performance. Led by Chief Project
        Engineer Akio Uchiyama, Mazda's development team focused on the American
        market, drawing inspiration from successful sports cars like the Porsche
        928. The shift from the live rear axle to Independent Rear Suspension
        (IRS) significantly improved the rear-end design, reducing oversteer
        tendencies. The FC RX-7 featured rack and pinion steering, standard disc
        brakes, and optional rear seats in some models. Innovations like the
        Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) and Auto Adjusting Suspension
        (AAS) contributed to improved driving dynamics, providing passive rear
        steering and adaptable damping characteristics. In Japan, the limited
        edition Infini series, produced in various series from 1987 to 1990,
        stood out with its exclusive features, upgraded suspension, higher power
        output, and distinctive exterior elements. The Turbo II model, featuring
        a twin-scroll turbocharger, showcased a nuanced design to counter turbo
        lag, and its air-to-air intercooler contributed to increased power
        output. The Australian Motors Mazda introduced a unique 'Sports' model
        Series 4 RX-7, limiting it to 250 units, stripping away power steering,
        power windows, and rear wipers to reduce the car's weight and enhance
        its performance appeal.

        The third-generation RX-7, commonly known as FD (chassis code FD3S for
        Japan and JM1FD for North America), debuted in October 1991, featuring a
        revolutionary body design. With production commencing later that month
        and sales launching in December in Japan, the Left-Hand-Drive export
        followed shortly after. The FD RX-7 was equipped with the 13B-REW
        engine, introducing the first-ever mass-produced sequential
        twin-turbocharger system exported from Japan. Designed by Yoichi Sato,
        with contributions from Wu-huang Chin, this model marked a departure
        from Japanese dimension regulations, impacting domestic sales with
        annual taxes for its non-compliant width. As an upper-level luxury
        sports car due to increased dimensions, Mazda countered by offering
        smaller alternatives like the Eunos Roadster and the Eunos Presso
        hatchback in Japan. The intricate sequential twin-turbocharging system,
        developed with Hitachi, brought complexity to the engine. Operating with
        two turbochargers, it provided a boost at different rpm ranges, offering
        semi-linear acceleration and a wide torque curve throughout the rev
        range under normal conditions. However, the system's complexity and
        susceptibility to failure due to high temperatures posed challenges,
        requiring technical drivers to adapt their driving style, especially
        during high-speed conditions and cornering.
