      <h2>How Mitsubishi Threw Away a Dynasty</h2>
      <p>
        It all started in 1971 when Mitsubishi used the Galant as their weopon
        of choice. They signed a driver named Andrew Cowan was signed on to
        Mitsubishi's rally team. Cowan showcased his exceptional skills and
        resilience, leaving an indelible mark on the world of rallying. Notably,
        Cowan claimed victory in the first two London-Sydney Marathons in 1968
        and 1977, showcasing his prowess in the grueling world of long-distance
        rallying. His triumphs extended to five consecutive Southern Cross
        Rallies from 1972 to 1976, the 1977 Rallye Bandama Côte d'Ivoire, and
        the monumental 20,000-mile South American Marathon in 1978, solidifying
        his reputation as a force to be reckoned with. Even in the challenging
        Safari Rally, Cowan recorded top-four finishes four times in five years,
        and in the later years, he demonstrated his competitive spirit in the
        Paris-Dakar Rally, achieving an impressive second overall in 1985.
        Marking the end of an illustrious career, Cowan gracefully retired as a
        driver in 1990, leaving behind a legacy of triumphs and remarkable
        achievements in the world of rallying.

        Then Mitsubishi created the Starion 4WD. The Starion 4WD, despite its
        untimely demise due to the cancellation of Group B, left a lasting
        legacy of innovation and performance. Although the all-wheel-drive
        variant was not fully developed, its foray into off-road racing was
        limited, yet it found substantial success in Group A World Rally
        Championships and Asia Pacific Rally Championships in 1987 and 1988. The
        aborted attempt at a Group B version, a rare venture for a Japanese
        manufacturer in this class, showcased pioneering design features. The
        conversion to all-wheel drive involved adding a reinforced transfer case
        from a Pajero behind the transmission, allowing for a rearward engine
        placement that enhanced front/rear weight distribution compared to the
        Audi Quattro. Despite maintaining the same wheelbase, the utilization of
        regular headlights instead of pop-up headlights shortened the nose by
        six inches, reducing weight. The incorporation of carbon fiber for
        driveshafts, sumpguard, and suspension components, along with fiberglass
        for various body parts, resulted in a final weight of under 1,000 kg,
        lighter than the Audi Quattro. Powered by a turbocharged and intercooled
        2.0 L fuel-injected engine, the ultimate aspiration was a 261 kW (355
        PS; 350 hp) turbocharged and intercooled version of the Sirius Dash
        engine. Developed and campaigned by Team Ralliart in Essex, Great
        Britain, under the expertise of rally veteran Andrew Cowan and engineer
        Alan Wilkinson, who previously contributed to the Audi Quattro's
        development, the Starion's unrealized potential in Group B remains a
        captivating chapter in motorsports history.

        Tommi Mäkinen's rallying legacy reached its pinnacle with a significant
        victory at the Safari Rally in 1996, setting the foundation for a
        dominant championship lead that he further solidified by clinching the
        title in Australia, besting his long-time rival, Subaru's Colin McRae.
        Mäkinen's prowess behind the wheel was undeniable as he went on to
        secure every drivers' title for Mitsubishi from 1996 to 1999. In 1998,
        Mitsubishi, with Mäkinen and young Briton Richard Burns on their driver
        roster, also celebrated their sole manufacturers' championship. The same
        year witnessed the release of the licensed Tommi Mäkinen Rally video
        game, cementing his iconic status in the motorsport world. Despite
        opening the 2000 campaign with a victory in the Monte Carlo Rally,
        Mäkinen relinquished his title to fellow Finn Marcus Grönholm.
        Mitsubishi paid homage to Mäkinen's previous successes by producing a
        special 'Tommi Mäkinen edition' of the Lancer Evolution VI. His tenure
        with Mitsubishi concluded in 2001, marked by the team's inauspicious
        introduction of their first-ever World Rally Car on the San Remo Rally.
        Unfortunately, Mäkinen's crash in Corsica, breaking co-driver
        Mannisenmäki's back, virtually ended his top-line career. The Finn
        continued to compete with substitute co-drivers in Australia (with Timo
        Hantunen) and Great Britain, where his retirement aided Burns in
        claiming the championship.

        The fate of the iconic Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution took a turn in March
        2011 when rumors of discontinuation surfaced after an interview with
        Gayu Uesugi, Mitsubishi's Global Product Director, hinted at the end of
        the Evo era. Despite initial concerns, Mitsubishi Motors clarified that
        the production of the current Lancer Evolution would continue as
        planned, leaving room for speculation about the successor. Industry
        analysts interpreted the statements as an indication that the Evolution
        nameplate might endure, adapting to environmentally friendly powertrains
        such as electric or hybrid systems. Autocar UK later updated its post,
        alluding to the use of electric vehicle (EV) technology in the next
        Evolution model, particularly the Mitsubishi Concept PX-MiEV hybrid
        drivetrain. In October 2011, President Osamu Masuko confirmed that work
        on the next Evo would commence in 2012, featuring electric power from a
        hybrid drivetrain while maintaining performance. However, the news took
        a somber turn in late March 2014 when it was officially announced that
        the production of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution would cease after the
        2015 model year. Mitsubishi shifted its focus to crossover vehicles and
        electric vehicles, signaling the end of an era for the high-performance
        four-wheel-drive sedan.
