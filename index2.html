      <h2>How a Top Secret Supercar Saved an Icon</h2>
      <p>
        The first Chevrolet Corvette, called C1, debuted in 1953 after being
        showcased at the 1953 General Motors Motorama. It started mass
        production in June 1953 with hand-placed fiberglass bodywork. The 1953
        model was Polo White, and later years brought new colors and a V8 engine
        in 1955. The 1956 model had a new body, and 1958 saw various revisions.
        In 1961, the rear underwent a significant redesign. The last year of
        this generation, 1962, featured a larger Small-Block engine. The second
        generation, C2 (1963 to 1967), introduced the Sting Ray with hidden
        headlamps and independent rear suspension. The third generation, C3
        (1968 to 1982), featured T-top removable roof panels and introduced
        monikers like LT-1 and ZR-1. Styling changes continued until the 1978
        25th Anniversary model with a fastback glass rear window. Production
        concluded in 1982 with various engine options and design changes.

        The fourth-generation Corvette, the first redesign since 1963, was set
        to start production in 1983, but issues led to only 43 prototypes for
        that year. All 1983 prototypes were either destroyed or labeled as 1984
        models, except one. This surviving prototype, with testing and
        modifications, now sits at the National Corvette Museum. Regular
        production began in January 1983 for the 1984 model year, featuring a
        more powerful "Crossfire" V8 engine. Changes included aluminum brake
        calipers, a Targa top, and a new electronic dashboard. In 1986, the
        second Corvette Indy Pace Car was released, and a third center brake
        light was added in 1986 for safety. The 35th Anniversary Edition came in
        1988, and 1990 saw the introduction of the ZR1 option with the LT5
        engine. The 1996 Grand Sport marked the end of the C4 production, with
        1,000 units produced.

        The C5 Corvette, introduced in 1997, was a ground-up redesign due to
        declining sales of the previous generation. It featured a new LS1
        aluminum engine, initially rated at 345 hp and 350 lbâ‹…ft, later
        increased to 350 hp in 2001. The C5 had innovations like a 0.29 drag
        coefficient, lower weight with balanced distribution, and active
        handling. Its top speed was 176 mph, noted for improved dynamics over
        the C4. The model was available as a coupe in 1997 and as a convertible
        in 1998, with a fixed-roof coupe (FRC) introduced in 1999. The
        high-performance Z06, using an LS6 engine with 385 hp, replaced the FRC
        model in 2001. The Z06 featured a rigid fixed roof for enhanced
        handling, upgraded brakes, and weight-saving materials. The LS6 was
        later upgraded to 405 hp for 2002 to 2004.

        The C6 Corvette, introduced in 2005, focused on refining the C5 rather
        than a complete redesign. It had an increased wheelbase, reduced body
        overhangs, and fixed headlights, a departure since 1962. The interior
        was improved, offering more passenger hip room. The LS1/LS6 engine
        became the LS2, with a displacement increase to 6.0 liters, producing
        400 hp. The C6 didn't match the previous generation's fuel economy,
        achieving 16/26 mpg. The Z06, starting in 2006, featured a 7.0 L LS7
        engine with 505 hp and a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.7 seconds. In 2008, the
        Corvette received updates, including the LS3 engine and improved
        transmissions. The ZR1, introduced in 2009, had an LS9 engine with 638
        hp and a top speed of 205 mph. The Grand Sport returned in 2010,
        replacing the Z51 option. The C6's last model year was 2013, with the
        final unit produced in February. In 2013, a federal investigation into
        lighting system problems for over 100,000 C6 Corvettes was announced in
        May.
