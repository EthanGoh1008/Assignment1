        <h2>How a Murderous Prince Stole the American HyperCar</h2>
        <p>
          The Vector W8, manufactured by the American automaker Vector
          Aeromotive Corporation from 1989 to 1993, stands as a testament to the
          vision of company founder Gerald Wiegert and the ingenuity of chief
          designer David Kostka. Originating from the Vector W2 prototype
          showcased throughout the 1980s, the W8 marked the realization of
          Wiegert's dream to create the ultimate sports car. Inspired by the
          futuristic design of the Alfa Romeo Carabo and incorporating elements
          reminiscent of contemporary fighter jets, the W8 boasted cutting-edge
          aerospace materials, passing rigorous crash and emissions tests before
          production.

        <p>
          Underpinning the W8's performance was a Rodeck V8 engine, a 6.0 L
          twin-turbocharged powerhouse with exceptional specifications. The
          car's semi-aluminum monocoque chassis, constructed with advanced
          materials like carbon fiber and Kevlar, showcased the commitment to
          innovation. The W8's dynamic capabilities were enhanced by a
          sophisticated suspension system, bespoke Michelin tires, and powerful
          brakes. The interior, exuding luxury with leather, suede, and Recaro
          seats, featured a driver-centric design reminiscent of fighter jet
          cockpits, omitting certain amenities for a lower curb weight.

        <p>
          Vector's performance claims for the W8 were impressive, asserting a
          projected top speed of 242 mph and a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 3.9
          seconds. However, real-world tests by publications like Road & Track
          and Car and Driver yielded slightly varied results. The W8's
          aerodynamic design underwent refinements during production, resulting
          in subtle changes to its appearance. Unfortunately, despite its
          technological prowess and limited production of nineteen units, Vector
          succumbed to financial challenges in 1993, marking the end of the W8's
          production and the company's receivership.

        <h2>How a Top Secret Supercar Saved an Icon</h2>
        <p>
          The first Chevrolet Corvette, called C1, debuted in 1953 after being
          showcased at the 1953 General Motors Motorama. It started mass
          production in June 1953 with hand-placed fiberglass bodywork. The 1953
          model was Polo White, and later years brought new colors and a V8
          engine in 1955. The 1956 model had a new body, and 1958 saw various
          revisions. In 1961, the rear underwent a significant redesign. The
          last year of this generation, 1962, featured a larger Small-Block
          engine. The second generation, C2 (1963–1967), introduced the Sting
          Ray with hidden headlamps and independent rear suspension. The third
          generation, C3 (1968–1982), featured T-top removable roof panels and
          introduced monikers like LT-1 and ZR-1. Styling changes continued
          until the 1978 25th Anniversary model with a fastback glass rear
          window. Production concluded in 1982 with various engine options and
          design changes.

        <p>
          The fourth-generation Corvette, the first redesign since 1963, was set
          to start production in 1983, but issues led to only 43 prototypes for
          that year. All 1983 prototypes were either destroyed or labeled as
          1984 models, except one. This surviving prototype, with testing and
          modifications, now sits at the National Corvette Museum. Regular
          production began in January 1983 for the 1984 model year, featuring a
          more powerful "Crossfire" V8 engine. Changes included aluminum brake
          calipers, a Targa top, and a new electronic dashboard. In 1986, the
          second Corvette Indy Pace Car was released, and a third center brake
          light was added in 1986 for safety. The 35th Anniversary Edition came
          in 1988, and 1990 saw the introduction of the ZR1 option with the LT5
          engine. The 1996 Grand Sport marked the end of the C4 production, with
          1,000 units produced.

          The C5 Corvette, introduced in 1997, was a ground-up redesign due to
          declining sales of the previous generation. It featured a new LS1
          aluminum engine, initially rated at 345 hp and 350 lb⋅ft, later
          increased to 350 hp in 2001. The C5 had innovations like a 0.29 drag
          coefficient, lower weight with balanced distribution, and active
          handling. Its top speed was 176 mph, noted for improved dynamics over
          the C4. The model was available as a coupe in 1997 and as a
          convertible in 1998, with a fixed-roof coupe (FRC) introduced in 1999.
          The high-performance Z06, using an LS6 engine with 385 hp, replaced
          the FRC model in 2001. The Z06 featured a rigid fixed roof for
          enhanced handling, upgraded brakes, and weight-saving materials. The
          LS6 was later upgraded to 405 hp for 2002 to 2004.

        <p>
          The C6 Corvette, introduced in 2005, focused on refining the C5 rather
          than a complete redesign. It had an increased wheelbase, reduced body
          overhangs, and fixed headlights, a departure since 1962. The interior
          was improved, offering more passenger hip room. The LS1/LS6 engine
          became the LS2, with a displacement increase to 6.0 liters, producing
          400 hp. The C6 didn't match the previous generation's fuel economy,
          achieving 16/26 mpg. The Z06, starting in 2006, featured a 7.0 L LS7
          engine with 505 hp and a 0–60 mph time of 3.7 seconds. In 2008, the
          Corvette received updates, including the LS3 engine and improved
          transmissions. The ZR1, introduced in 2009, had an LS9 engine with 638
          hp and a top speed of 205 mph. The Grand Sport returned in 2010,
          replacing the Z51 option. The C6's last model year was 2013, with the
          final unit produced in February. In 2013, a federal investigation into
          lighting system problems for over 100,000 C6 Corvettes was announced
          in May.
