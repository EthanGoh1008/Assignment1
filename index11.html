      <h2>How a Bunch of Rebels Built a Killer Supercar</h2>
      <p>
        Conceived in late 1988 at Chrysler's Advanced Design Studios, the Dodge
        Viper's inception traced back to a visionary idea. Chrysler president
        Bob Lutz, in February of the following year, proposed the production of
        a modern Cobra to Tom Gale at Chrysler Design Center. A clay model
        materialized a few months later and, produced in sheet metal by
        Metalcrafters, debuted as a concept at the North American International
        Auto Show in 1989. The overwhelming public enthusiasm prompted chief
        engineer Roy Sjoberg to embark on its development as a standard
        production vehicle. However, Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca initially
        hesitated, delaying approval for the required $70 million investment due
        to concerns about financial return. Undeterred, Sjoberg assembled "Team
        Viper" in March 1989, collaborating with Lamborghini for a prototype
        aluminum block. By May 1990, official approval was granted, and in
        November 1991, reviewers got their hands on the Viper, with retail
        shipments commencing in January 1992. Priced at $52,000, the powerful
        two-seater not only captured enthusiasts' hearts but also revitalized
        the Dodge brand, overshadowing previous setbacks and earning admiration
        from both automotive press and enthusiasts alike.

        The Dodge Viper, known for its raw and purist approach to performance,
        eschewed modern driver aids like traction control and anti-lock brakes,
        offering a driving experience devoid of electronic interventions. The
        absence of exterior-mounted door handles and key locks meant
        unconventional entry – achieved by unzipping a vinyl window to reach the
        interior door release handle, especially when the canvas or hard top was
        in place. In its early iterations, the Viper lacked air conditioning and
        airbags for weight reduction purposes, and its roof was made from
        canvas, with vinyl windows operated by zippers. Despite these Spartan
        choices, the Viper accommodated daily driving with manually-adjustable
        seats featuring lumbar support, an AM/FM cassette stereo player, a
        clock, and carpeting. Later models introduced the option for a
        lightweight fiberglass hard top as an alternative to the standard canvas
        soft top, providing further versatility. The collaboration with
        Lamborghini, then owned by Chrysler Corporation, played a pivotal role
        in crafting the aluminum-alloy V10 engine, drawing inspiration from
        Chrysler's LA engine. Chief power engineer Dick Winkles, a significant
        contributor to the engine project, even spent time in Italy for its
        development, highlighting the international influence on the Viper's
        iconic powertrain.

        The heart of the Dodge Viper's performance lies in its formidable
        engine, boasting a maximum power output of 400 hp at 4,600 rpm and a
        robust torque of 465 lb⋅ft at 3,600 rpm, all while weighing 323 kg. This
        powerhouse, coupled with long gearing, contributes to the Viper's fuel
        economy, rated at 12 mpg during city driving and an impressive 20 mpg on
        the highway by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The
        Viper's agility is further accentuated by its curb weight of 1,490 kg,
        featuring a tubular steel frame and resin-transfer molding fiberglass
        panels. Accelerating from 0–60 mph in 4.6 seconds and reaching a maximum
        speed of 165 mph, the Viper's prowess on the road is underscored by its
        quarter-mile time of 12.6 seconds at a speed of 113.8 mph. With large
        tires providing an average lateral g-force of 0.96 in corners, the Viper
        stood among the best performance cars of its era, although its
        formidable capabilities made it a demanding drive for the unskilled.
