        The Toyota Land Cruiser has the longest running history within the
        entire Toyota lineup. It originates back to the 1950s, just after World
        War II. As a result of World War II, the recession had a direct impact
        on the automotive industry and created one of the most difficult time
        periods for Toyota as a company (Toyota Global). When the Korean War
        begun, Japan was still under the influence of America and played a role
        as a supply base. The United States needed military vehicles for use
        throughout the Asia region, and as a result Toyota begun designing these
        types of vehicles to meet demands. There were many Jeeps being driven in
        Japan during this time and that was when the Toyota Jeep BJ was
        introduced in 1951. The Toyota Jeep BJ consisted of a combined B-type
        engine with a Jeep model. Fast forward to 1954, the Toyota Jeep was
        renamed as “Land Cruiser” due to trademark issues between American
        Automakers claiming ownership of the “Jeep” name. United States
        consumers were not able to purchase the Toyota Land Cruiser until about
        1958 and they say the rest is history (Car and Driver). The original
        Toyota Land Cruiser consisted of three different body variations;
        Light-Duty, Station Wagon & Heavy Duty. Light-Duty included Series 70,
        90, and 120; Station Wagon included Series 55, 60, 80 and 100, and
        Heavy-Duty included Series BJ, 20, 40, and 70 (Toyota Global).

        The J60 series Toyota Land Cruiser, also known as the FJ60 in certain
        markets, holds significance as the third generation of the Land
        Cruiser's 60 series, manufactured from 1980 to 1990. Embodying a rugged
        and utilitarian design typical of its era, the J60 was offered in
        various body styles, prominently featuring a four-door wagon
        configuration. It boasted a solid front axle and leaf-spring suspension,
        contributing to its reputation for robust off-road capabilities. The J60
        came equipped with a range of engine options, including a 4.2-liter
        inline-six gasoline engine and a 4.0-liter inline-six diesel engine,
        renowned for their reliability and longevity. Its part-time
        four-wheel-drive system ensured optimal traction in diverse terrains,
        solidifying its position as a stalwart off-road vehicle.

        Internationally acclaimed for its durability and off-road prowess, the

        regions where rugged and reliable off-road vehicles were in demand.
        While its interior was relatively basic, emphasizing functionality over
