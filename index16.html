      <h2>NSX: How Honda Broke Supercars</h2>
      <p>
        The Honda NSX, known as the Acura NSX in North America, is a remarkable
        two-seater, mid-engined coupe sports car crafted by Honda. Originating
        in 1984 with the HP-X (Honda Pininfarina eXperimental) concept,
        featuring a mid-engine 3.0 L V6 engine and rear-wheel drive, the NSX
        project was born with the ambitious goal of surpassing the performance
        of Ferrari's V8 engine range while maintaining reliability and a more
        accessible price point. The concept evolved, adopting the name NS-X,
        representing "New," "Sportscar," and "eXperimental." When launched as
        the NSX, it left an indelible mark on the automotive world. Notably,
        Gordon Murray, the visionary behind the McLaren F1 supercar, drew
        inspiration from the NSX after test-driving numerous high-performance
        vehicles. Impressed by the NSX's chassis performance, Murray considered
        it "monumental" for sportscar design, even though he advocated for a
        more potent engine, a suggestion Honda declined. Despite this, Murray's
        admiration for the NSX endured, leading him to personally own and drive
        one for 75,000 kilometers, declaring the NSX "dear to his heart."

        Designed under the leadership of Chief Designer Masahito Nakano and
        Executive Chief Engineer Shigeru Uehara, the NSX stands as an automotive
        marvel, incorporating advanced aerodynamics and drawing inspiration from
        the cockpit of an F-16 fighter jet. Notably, the late Formula One World
        Champion Ayrton Senna contributed invaluable insights during the final
        stages of development. This groundbreaking vehicle marked a historic
        milestone as the world's first mass-produced car with an all-aluminium
        body. Its powerhouse featured an all-aluminium 3.0 L V6 engine equipped
        with Honda's innovative VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic
        Control) system, complemented by a 5-speed manual transmission or the
        SportShift 4-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1994. Premiering
        at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show and produced in a purpose-built factory in
        Japan, the NSX became available for purchase in 1990, initially as a
        coup√© and later, from 1995, as a targa top. The first-generation NSX
        underwent significant transformations, including a performance upgrade
        in 1997 with a larger 3.2 L V6 engine and a 2002 facelift that bid
        farewell to the iconic pop-up headlights. North American models bore the
        Acura NSX moniker, and the first-generation NSX concluded its
        illustrious run in 2005, distinguishing between NA1 models with the 3.0
        L C30A engine and NA2 models featuring the 3.2 L C32B engine.

        The NSX GT1 and GT2 Le Mans race cars, originating from factory NSX-R
        shells, underwent a radical transformation at TC Prototypes in England.
        Eleven shells were meticulously reworked, incorporating a custom dry
        carbon fiber tub and additional pieces to enhance chassis stiffness. The
        suspension received a bespoke setup with race dampers, aluminum control
        arms, and center-nut style wheel hubs, while wide body fenders
        accommodated race tires, enhancing downforce. The C30A engine underwent
        extensive revisions, featuring a dry sump oiling system, larger cams,
        and inconel exhaust headers. GT2 variants boasted a massive carbon fiber
        intake plenum with six individual throttle bodies, while GT1 engines
        adopted a turbocharger with a custom dual-plenum aluminum manifold.
        Utilizing bespoke engine management, the GT2 engines produced nearly 400
        bhp, a substantial increase from the production version, and the
        turbocharged GT1 engines exceeded 600 bhp, marking them as Honda's most
        powerful NSX engines. Both engines were coupled with a Hewland 6-speed
        sequential transmission. The NSX made noteworthy appearances at the 24
        Hours of Le Mans in 1994, 1995, and 1996. In 1994, three NSXs entered
        the GT2 class, finishing 14th, 16th, and 18th. The 1995 edition saw
        factory and Team Kunimitsu entries, with a GT2 NSX securing 8th place.
        The 1996 race featured the return of Team Kunimitsu, finishing 16th
        overall and third in the GT2 class after completing 305 laps.
