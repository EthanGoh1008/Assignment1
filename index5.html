      <h2>GT-R: How Nissan Created the Giantkiller</h2>
      <p>
        The Nissan GT-R, designated as R35, has been a pinnacle in Japanese
        automotive engineering since its debut in 2007, marking the revival of
        the GT-R brand as part of Nissan's ambitious Revival Plan. Departing
        from its Skyline lineage, this 2+2 sports car and grand tourer boasts a
        front-mid engine configuration and an all-wheel-drive system, setting it
        apart from its predecessors. Developed over seven years, the GT-R made
        its production debut in 2007 at the Tokyo Motor Show, showcasing
        groundbreaking features like advanced aerodynamics, the VR38DETT engine,
        an active suspension system, and the innovative ATTESA E-TS Pro
        all-wheel-drive system. Notably, it became one of the first rear-mounted
        independent transaxle all-wheel-drive vehicles globally, featuring
        launch control and a dual-clutch transmission. Constructed on the PM
        platform, derived from the FM platform utilized in Skyline and Nissan Z
        models, the GT-R combines steel, aluminum, and carbon-fiber components.
        Its global availability, frequent facelifts, and special editions
        testify to its enduring popularity, complemented by its impressive
        motorsports record and critical acclaim, earning accolades like the
        World Performance Car of The Year and Top Gear's recognition as "one of
        the most incredible cars ever built." Celebrating its one-year
        anniversary, the Nissan GT-R remains an iconic blend of performance,
        practicality, and affordability in the world of high-performance
        automobiles.

        In the ambitious pursuit of rejuvenating the Nissan brand, CEO Carlos
        Ghosn initiated the revival of the iconic GT-R as a centerpiece of the
        Nissan Revival Plan in 2000. Ghosn envisioned the GT-R not just as a
        sports car but as a high-performance contender capable of rivaling the
        likes of Porsche, Lamborghini, and Ferrari, all while maintaining an
        affordable price point. This endeavor brought together a team of top
        engineers and designers, under the leadership of Chief Engineer
        Kazutoshi Mizuno, known as Mr. GT-R. Initially hesitant due to platform
        constraints, Mizuno eventually gained autonomy and spearheaded the
        development on the innovative Premium Midship (PM) platform.
        Concurrently, a specialized team, curated by Ghosn, meticulously
        developed the drivetrain and chassis, pushing the GT-R's performance
        boundaries during extensive testing at the Nürburgring and Sendai
        Hi-Land Raceway. The engineering marvel continued with the creation of
        the VR38DETT 3.8L twin-turbocharged V6 engine, a departure from the
        initially planned straight-6 engine. Simultaneously, a dedicated team
        tackled the complex challenge of aerodynamics, aiming for a delicate
        balance between downforce and minimal drag. Over six years of
        development, involving numerous wind tunnel tests and refinements, the
        engineers achieved a visually appealing exterior with a drag coefficient
        of Cd=0.27 combined with front and rear downforce. Finally, after a
        dedicated year of testing, Nissan proudly unveiled the production
        version at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, marking the culmination of years
        of innovation, determination, and collaborative effort. Ghosn's vision
        materialized, dispelling rumors and confirming the global release of the
        GT-R as a Nissan model, a testament to its potential profitability and
        enduring impact on the automotive world.

        The production version of the GT-R made a dramatic entrance at the 2007
        Tokyo Motor Show, solidifying its reputation as a groundbreaking
        supercar. The unveiling followed an exhilarating on-screen showcase of
        the GT-R's capabilities, featuring a remarkable 7:38.54-minute lap time
        in challenging, damp conditions around the Nürburgring Nordschleife.
        This impressive performance outshone the benchmark Porsche 911 Turbo,
        which held a lap time of 7:40 minutes, leading Nissan to proudly claim
        the record for the fastest lap time for a mass-produced car. Positioned
        as "A supercar, for Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime," the GT-R's unveiling
        generated significant anticipation and excitement. In November 2007,
        just before its official launch, Nissan revealed an overwhelming demand
        for the GT-R, with more than 3,000 buyers pre-ordering the car in Japan.
        This fervor reflected the global enthusiasm for this high-performance
        marvel. To maintain exclusivity, Nissan aimed to sell approximately 200
        units per month. Deliveries commenced on December 6, 2007, in Japan,
        followed by North America on July 7, 2008, and Europe in March 2009.
        Notably, the first production GT-R was proudly acquired by Nissan's CEO
        at the time, Carlos Ghosn, underscoring the significance of the GT-R in
        Nissan's leadership. The staggered regional releases were influenced by
        the strategic need for Nissan to establish GT-R performance centers for
        servicing, reflecting the brand's commitment to providing exceptional
        customer experiences worldwide.
